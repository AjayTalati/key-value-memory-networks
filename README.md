# Key Value Memory Networks

This repo contains the implementation of [Key Value Memory Networks for Directly Reading Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03126) in Tensorflow. The model is tested on [bAbI](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05698).

There is a [must-read tutorial](http://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/icml2016/) on Memory Networks for NLP from Jason Weston @ ICML 2016.
